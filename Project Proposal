###Sentiment Classification on Arabic Texts

Nowadays, millions of users are expressing their opinions and feelings regarding different life aspects or received products and services, resulting in a massive amount of opinionated texts. Such a rich source had encouraged both business and data scientists to try diving in texts and obtain useful insights and predictions.

##Question/need:
* The purpose of this project is twofold:
** Build a model (classifier) that can discover the sentiment of Arabic sentences as either positive or negative.
** Investigate the impact on performance as a result of using different Arabic data (MSA and two dialects)
* Business, content makers and social bloggers can benefit from building this model by monitoring comments and feedbacks of their customers/followers and take faster reactions whe7n needed.
